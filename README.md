# Implementation of Smalltalk on the DLR. 

**The immediate goal of the project is to create a Smalltalk dialect that:**
1. Is X3J20 (ANSI INCITS 319-1998) Compliant Smalltalk 
2. Is First Class Member of the DLR Family 
3. Has an easy / transparent interop with .Net 
4. Has Decent Performance

**Future goals include:**
1. A GUI interface layer; at some point hopefully having a system that could target either XAML or XNA. 
2. Better integration with .Net languages, class libraries and tools.

**There are 3 things you can do if you would like to help out with this project:**
1. Become familiar with X3J20 (http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSIINCITS319-1998+(R2007)) 
2. Study how the DLR works. There are some useful links in the Documentation directory of the source download. 
3. Start playing!

**To understand and build the project:**
1. Open and read the [src/ReadMe.md](/docs/ReadMe.dm) file.
