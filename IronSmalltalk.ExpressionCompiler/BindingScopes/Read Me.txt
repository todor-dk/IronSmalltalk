Binding Scopes class hierarchy models the binding scopes for different code scenarios.

Depending on the type of method or initializer, a different type of binding scope is needed, as defined in X3J20.

The main method is the GetBinding() method, which returns the binding between an identifier and the variable it represents.

The DefineBinding() method can be used for certain binding scopes to define variables (such as temp variables or arguments).


Binding Scopes can be nested. Lookup is performed in the inner scope, then the outer scope(s). If lookup fails, null is returned.
